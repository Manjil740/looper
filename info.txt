so this code can certainly cause alot of problem thats obvious
this code will first give random string output which will occupie the RAM very fast causing it to lag 
after 99 percentage of RAM is occupied it will automatically shutdown the device 
NOTE: this code is still incomplete so updates will come in this improving more things in it
NOTE: shutdown feature is commented for some safety reasons. So feel free to uncomment it
